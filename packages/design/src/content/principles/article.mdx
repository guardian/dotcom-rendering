Articles are the bread and butter of the Guardian. Every day, More than 
8 million people read our award winning journalism on digital platforms.

Here's a quick reference of how all of this comes together. All articles 
live in `CAPI` but are then rendered by `frontend` and `dotcom-rendering`
(web and AMP), and mobile apps.

## Skeleton of an article

This is the order the parts of an article should flow in the page:

-   Header
-   Headline
-   Meta
-   Main media
-   Article body
-   Atoms
-   Contributions ask
-   Onward
-   Comments & sharing
-   Footer

Our article works across a multitude of platforms, screen sizes, and 
devices and is read by many types of users. In scenarios where the reader 
can quickly scan a full page and select what information to read (meaning 
screens, not screen readers or smart speakers) it is okay to be more bold
with the article, and intersect related content and atoms in the middle.

<ResearchAside>
    Screen reader users <b>really</b> dislike atoms in the middle of the
    article. Attempt to condense them at the end of the article using CSS
    techniques like regions and link to them.

If you are building a new part of an article try to make sure this order 
is still preserved and test it with a screen reader.
