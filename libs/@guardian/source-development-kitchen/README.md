# @guardian/source-development-kitchen

This is temporary placeholder for the real source code that we hope to move here from CSNX.

For now, it simply re-exports the NPM package, which is still published from CSNX.

The actual source code still lives in https://github.com/guardian/csnx/tree/main/libs/%40guardian/source-development-kitchen (for now).
