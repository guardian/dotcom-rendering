/**
 * Tests are defined here. They will be assigned mvt ranges based on the
 * size of the test and the number of groups, these ranges may not be contiguous.
 *
 * For 100% tests to run concurrently with other tests, they should be assigned to different
 * test spaces. This means that some users will be in multiple tests at the same time.
 *
 * Example:
 * [Space A]
 * - 20% Test	control		MVT 0-99
 * - 20% Test	variant		MVT 100-199
 * - 50% Test	control		MVT 200-449
 * - 50% Test	variant		MVT 450-699
 *
 * [Space B]
 * - 100% Test	control		MVT 0-499
 * - 100% Test	variant		MVT 500-999
