## Heatphan selectors

## What is the contract?

Within the article body, we add the following attributes to certain elements:

-   `data-heatphan-type`: This denotes the component or element type, eg "carousel"

These are elements that heatphan needs to be able to find and modify for heatphan to function correctly.

## Where is it relied upon?

It is relied upon by Ophan.

## Why is it required?

This allows Heatphan to find elements and then adjusts the CSS/HTML of the page (typically a Front) in order to dynamically modify the appearance and structure of the element.
