# AMP Removal

## Context

Google AMP is an open-source, website-publishing technology that enables you to create a website that loads almost instantly on mobile devices. AMP stands for “accelerated mobile pages.” Google created AMP so that publishers and businesses could avoid slow-loading web pages that frustrate users.

The pages loaded more quickly for users on constrained devices, and Google’s search algorithm had a requirement that stories that appeared in the top stories carousel would have to be amp pages.

In June 2021 an update to Google's Top Stories algorithm meant AMP was no longer needed to appear in top stories. In November 2021 Twitter phased out support for AMP.

### Negatives

-   Issues with maintaining and updating AMP as a separate platform from a technical perspective

-   User experience impact of sign in & cookies for AMP

-   Design opportunities are limited on AMP

-   The website accessibility and performance improvements we make only affect web/apps

-   Better user experience editorially to land on a Guardian page than an AMP page when coming via Google

-   For contributions AMP is the worst performing platform between Apple News, Web and AMP

## Decision

Following analysis of the trial period we switched off AMP completely on 7th January 2025.

AMP code can now be deleted.
