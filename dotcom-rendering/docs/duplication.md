# Duplication

We have reached a point where key logic and styling is duplicated across this
codebase and [frontend](https://github.com/guardian/frontend).

This is inevitable, but we should document this and attempt to minimise time
where code exists in both.

Visual duplication:

-   (not listed here but includes key page structure including nav and footer, and
    article body for some cases)

Logical duplication:

-   social share icon links
-   tracking consent cookie logic
-   pillars
