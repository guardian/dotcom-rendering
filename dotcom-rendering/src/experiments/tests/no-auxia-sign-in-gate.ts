/**
 * The requirement:
 * 1. keep a fixed 5% of the global audience excluded from Auxia (though they can still see gates)
 * 2. track participation of this 5% in the pageview table, regardless of whether they see gates
 *
 * The solution:
 * - On every article view, put 5% of the audience into a special NoAuxiaSignInGate AB test. This means the page tracks membership of the "test" through ophan. There are no variants in this test, it's just a way to track these browsers.
 * - The API call for the sign-in gate includes a flag indicating that the browser is in the NoAuxiaSignInGate test, and it excludes them from Auxia based on this.
 *
 * This enables us to query the pageview table for browsers in the NoAuxiaSignInGate group using the existing ab_test_array field.
