// This type can be used in place of React.FC<T> which was previously widespread
// in this codebase but is no longer recommended. In many cases it's possible to
// omit the type completely, but as a team we felt that it was a shame to omit
// the type for our React components. The generic prop type is optional and
// defaults to an empty object so this type can also be used for components
// which take no props.
