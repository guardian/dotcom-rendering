No snacks this early in the USA, but we’re edging towards eggs on toast when the time becomes slightly more socially acceptable. What have you got on today? I feel deeply conflicted about this final. I desperately want England to win as an England fan, and I also desperately do not want Jorge Vilda to win. It’s nothing against the Spanish players; far from it. The current generation of Spanish footballers is incredibly talented, plays beautiful football, and I hope they do win major honours -- I just don’t want them to win whilst Vilda is manager. If they do, I worry the RFEF will double down and maybe offer him a new contract, whereas if Spain loses, the RFEF may be forced to sack him. I feel badly wishing ill on Vilda in that way, it’s just that the tension is palpable, it doesn’t appear that he’s helping the situation, and I feel for the Spanish players for having to put up with it. Do you (or indeed any other readers) feel the same/similar?” I think Vilda will stay in his role regardless of the result, getting to a World Cup final is impressive and so the federation may be reluctant to let him go.',

Here, I feel represented.” Having been to three other annual Pride events, she noted that this year’s felt less “commercial” with more of a focus on LGBTQ+ groups marching together than branded floats fronted by minor celebrities. “It feels bigger. It feels like everyone who’s here is enjoying it and has missed it - it’s nice to be back,” she added.',

As the Guardian chatted to Rosy, 23, a bisexual student enjoying her first Pride parade, she pointed out a group of anti-LGBT Christian protestors on the other side of the road. “Bit of a downer, but it just goes to show how important this still is,” she said, before quipping that a gay couple had been seen defiantly “snogging” in front of them.',
