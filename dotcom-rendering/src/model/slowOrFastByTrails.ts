 * An 'arbitrary list of slow tags' once defined in Frontend.

 *
 * The reasoning behind why it's these tags remains unclear, so I've written a small song

 *
 * ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶
 * And you may find yourself working on DCR
 * And you may find yourself looking at the tag page code
 * And you may ask yourself "What is the reason these tags are slow?"
 * And you may tell yourself "The reasoning must be documented somewhere"
 * And you may say to yourself "My god, why are there so many arbitrary rules?"
 *
 * Letting the trails go by, let the front speed hold me down...
