		<h2>Format</h2>
		<p>
			The <code>ArticleFormat</code>, sometimes known as just "Format",
			determines the kind of article being rendered. It influences what
			content and features the article will contain, and what the design
			will look like. It's broken down into three dimensions:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Design</dt>
			<dd>
				Primarily influences the content, structure and features of an
				article. It's the most important of the three, and is often used
				as a shorthand to describe the "kind" of article. The values
				are: {formatValues(ArticleDesign)}.
			</dd>
			<dt>Display</dt>
			<dd>
				Primarily influences the layout of an article. The values are:{' '}
				{formatValues(ArticleDisplay)}.
			</dd>
			<dt>Theme</dt>
			<dd>
				Primarily influences the fonts and colours of an article. It can
				can be thought of as a superset of "pillar", i.e. all the
				pillars are considered themes, but there are some additional
				themes that are not pillars. The values are:{' '}
				{formatValues(Pillar)}, {formatValues(ArticleSpecial)}.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			In theory all possible combinations of Format can exist and be
			rendered by DCAR. In practice there are some combinations that are
			not currently allowed by the tools, such as immersive liveblogs,
			which therefore cannot be found in CAPI.

		<p>
			Articles are the primary form of content on our platforms. They are
			written in Composer and stored in CAPI. There are many different
			kinds of article, and on DCAR this variety is captured by the{' '}
			<code>ArticleFormat</code> type (sometimes known as just "Format").
			In addition, aside from its ability to render article pages in full,
			DCAR can also render partial pages of{' '}
			<a href="live-updates">live updates</a> for liveblogs.
